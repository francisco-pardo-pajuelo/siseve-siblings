\begin{itemize}
    \item In centralized settings, it is common to keep the first set of choices/application. It is not clear I can do the same here since I don't (currently) have dates of exams, but even then, that would mean only keep 1 exam.
    \item I am considering 2 options: Use full sample and use only first semester of applications. I also considered using only those who apply once but sample is too small.
    \item I am not sure if using the full sample is methodologically correct, although it seems balanced. Results there however look very similar to \cite{altmejd_o_2021} in the case of choices.
    \item Main problem now is the balance is not working properly for 8th grade exams when keeping only the first semester.
\end{itemize}
